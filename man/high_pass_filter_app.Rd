\usage{
high_pass_filter_app()
}
\value{
A Shiny app interface for applying a high-pass filter and visualizing audio wave objects.

\description{
This function launches a Shiny app that allows users to apply a high-pass filter to audio wave objects and visualize either the mean spectrum or the spectrogram. Users can select an existing wave object from the R environment, apply a filter, and save the filtered wave object with a new name. The app also provides options to visualize the mean spectrum or the spectrogram of the selected wave object.
