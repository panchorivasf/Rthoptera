Description: The package provides a set of interactive functions (each one is a Shiny App) to analyze insect acoustic signals, including preprocessing (e.g., high-pass filter, remove DC offset, down-sampling, etc.). Analytical functions allow the user to automatically extract relevant acoustic features in both spectral and temporal dimensions.
